******** VERSION 1.5.1 *******
Thinkscroller:
* Added Flash support! Thinkscroller can now export to the Flash Player in Unity 3.5+.
* Removed extra debug code
* Added script compatibility down to Unity 3.3 (Asset Store download and example scenes still require Unity 3.5)

Thinkscroller:
* Added in-editor documentation! Browse the Thinkscroller docs directly in Unity.
* Updated reference manual to be much more robust, with a detailed component reference
* Removed ScrollLayerAlignment.cs

Example Project:
* Added a planet example scene

******** VERSION 1.4.1 ********

Thinkscroller:
* Animation curve support! Added a new ScrollLayerAnimation component - add this to a scroll layer to control it via animation curves
* Fixed an issue in the editor with texture names

******** VERSION 1.4.0 ********

Thinkscroller:
* Added manual viewport sizing to the Parallax Manager
* Billboards can now automatically refresh on LateUpdate (off by default; configured in the parallax manager)
* Object layers now move in pixel space by default (this can be changed in the scroll layer editor)
* Added more menu commands to create different types of layers

******** VERSION 1.3.3 ********

Thinkscroller:
* The offset property now always uses pixel values.
* Added alignment property for scroll layers

* Fixed various bugs in the example scenes

******** VERSION 1.3.2 ********

Thinkscroller:
* Fixed the double parallax manager issue (finally!)

******** VERSION 1.3.1 ********

Hotfix for a critical bug introduced in 1.3.

******** VERSION 1.3 ********
IMPORTANT NOTE: This will upgrade the current version of the common libraries, move some folders around, 
and will change the Thinkscroller namespace to ThinksquirrelSoftware.Thinkscroller to match Thinksquirrel 
coding standards, and keep compatibility with other Thinksquirrel Software products.

To upgrade:
1) Back up your project. Open the project and close all open scenes.
2) Completely remove the Plugins/Thinkscroller, Plugins/Thinksquirrel Common, and Editor/Thinksquirrel Software folders.
3) Install the new version from the Asset Store.
4) Change the Thinkscroller namespace in your scripts to ThinksquirrelSoftware.Thinkscroller

Other than the namespace change, the API won't change at all. Sorry for the inconvenience!

Thinkscroller:
* Changed namespaces/folders for various files
* Added offline documentation
* Removed LINQ dependency (No references to System.Core.dll or System.Xml.dll)
* ScrollLayers now implement IComparable
* Added stripped down version of the common libraries as a .NET extension (gets rid of redundant code)
* The common libraries are open source and can be found at https://github.com/Thinksquirrel-Software/Thinksquirrel-Common

Example Project:
* Added Component Menu options for example scripts
* Changed camera sizes to typical pixel-perfect sizes (half the screen height as orthographic size)

******** VERSION 1.2 ********
Thinkscroller:
* Got rid of Thinksquirrel Common Libraries dependency. You can safely delete the Thinksquirrel Common folder and TSInspectorBase class.
* Fixed an issue with the Parallax Manager being created more than once.
	- If you are creating a parallax manager from a script, make sure to call Parallax.CreateManager() before accessing any static functions!
* Fixed an issue with non-pixel perfect textures not working
* Added UV padding

Example project:
* Textures are compressed by default
	
******** VERSION 1.1 ********
Thinkscroller:
* Separated the default shader from the ScrollLayer script
* Added Object Layers! Disable Auto Billboards and enable "Object Layer"
	- Object layers scroll the transform and ignore any textures on the object
	- They can also scroll groups of objects, and work with physics
	- Fully compatible with most sprite/2D game management systems
	- Object Layers scroll in world space (relative to the parallax camera), as opposed to UV space
	- Object Layers can also be enabled and disabled through the API using the isObjectLayer property

******** VERSION 1.0.5 ********
Note: All negative scales need to be flipped, or textures may appear backwards.

Thinkscroller:
* Added advanced pixel perfect features (cropping, tiling)
* Added pixel fix for floating-point error compensation
* Fixed scale bug (scales were negative)
* Added API calls for all of the above

Example project:
* Added cropped textures and cropped example scene
* Bug fixes

******** VERSION 1.0.3 ********

Thinkscroller:
* Added SetMaterial() method
* Added tangent calculation
* Added advanced options
* Renamed common libraries
* Added extension methods

******** VERSION 1.0.2 ********
