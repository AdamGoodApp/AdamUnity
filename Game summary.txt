Game summary: Wild fire fighting game with helicopter with water pick up

Why we did this project: The tragedies of recent devastating fires have led our team to once more recognize the importance of fire safety. We wanted to make a multi-player game to increase the awareness of the uncontrollable nature of fire. In addition to increasing awareness, the players are given a chance to explore what the best way to fight fires are as a fire fighter. We have implemented a close-to-real-life fire propagation algorithms and fighting techniques, the effective strategies in real life would give advantages in this game. For example, fire fighters often perform a ‘criss-cross’ . By working as a team with multiple people, the users are also able to improve their cooperation skills, and communication skills while coming up with golden strategies in a limited time together.
